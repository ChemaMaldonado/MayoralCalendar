As we can see in the image:

1. Months can be selected in a dropdown menu which has been implemented for better reachability.


2. Employees show:
  - Employee icon.
  - Employee name. `alphabetically`
  - Employee available days. `avaiableDays/maxDays`


3. There are four types of buttons:

  - The ones which shows weekends. `red` `disabled` 
  - The ones which shows holidays. `blue` `disabled`
  - The ones which shows work days. `white` `enabled`
  - The ones which shows selected holidays. `green` `enabled`

4. There is also a `Reset calendar` button to enable whole calendar reset.
5. `Local Storage` functionality has been implemented so the state is maintain unless we reset it.

You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`
